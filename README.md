# Build full-stack web applications with ASP.NET Core

This repository contains the code from the "Build full-stack web applications with ASP.NET Core" book. You can buy the book from *LINK*.

## Project

By following the book, you will develop a web application that is able to schedule emails to be sent to you in the future. This includes simple features, such as saving data from a form in the database, to more advanced ones, such as sending confirmation emails and scheduling background tasks.

## Technologies

The project is developed with ASP.NET Core WebAPI and Blazor, with Hangfire being used for background tasks. A certain degree of knowledge of programming or C# is needed, but everything about ASP.NET Core is explained at a beginner level.
